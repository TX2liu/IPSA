# IPSA (**intelligent pathology somatology analyzer**)

The AI analyzer utilized the pyramid files to perform coarse registration and fusion of the reference image with the remaining IHC panoramic images, resulting in an initial fusion model. Subsequently, the pathologist identified the target lesion area within the HE panoramic image of the fusion model.
